Q2 2023: Cloud Engineering and Being a Teacher
IDUN Guardian's new native mobile apps showcase the effortless sleep brain monitoring experience.As we travel through time in 2023, it's again time to reflect on the past three-month journey. An important change in this quarter was a big opportunity I could take and circumstances that allowed me to do so. While I cannot yet disclose many details at this point, I am thrilled to share that some significant changes are on the horizon in my professional path towards whole brain emulation. Stay tuned for more details in the upcoming newsletter. But for now, let's rewind Q2 2023.
IDUN Guardian Post-Release
Following the successful release of the IDUN Guardian earlier this year, our team at IDUN Technologies has been hard at work responding to feedback from our early adopters and testers.
The IDUN Guardian Earbuds during meditation - a remarkable demonstration of their near-invisible design, highlighting the unparalleled integration as an unobtrusive brain-computer interface (IDUN Technologies, 2023).This iterative process of refining and adjusting our technology based on real-world usage of one of the first production-ready and mass-market targeted brain-computer interfaces has been an enriching learning experience and has provided invaluable insights. It was a great experience to witness it evolve and improve. I'm very much looking forward to where IDUN will be in the coming months.
Lecturer at SAE Institute
The past quarter marked some notable moments in my role at the SAE Institute. As the academic year reached its zenith, I deeply engaged in discussions and consultations with the three students I've been supporting for the last six months, guiding them through the final stages of their projects and thesis. Curiosity piques my interest as to where these students will go and what they will create after they complete their education.
Further enriching my experience, I delved into professional development, achieving two significant milestones: the AWS Cloud Developer and Terraform Associate Developer certificates. The AWS certification, in particular, holds a special place in my heart, as I have been eagerly delving ever deeper into this topic since the day I started working at IDUN Technologies. This pursuit of knowledge enriches not only my personal growth but also the quality of education I can provide to my students.
The AWS and Terraform badges.As a result of this continuous learning, I had the honour of sharing my enhanced knowledge on cloud computing and the spatial web as a guest lecturer. This enriching experience confirmed the old saying that the best way to learn something is to teach it. The feedback I received from students was overwhelmingly positive, prompting me to request the chance to teach more lessons in 2024, a request which the SAE Institute graciously approved.
I look forward to teaching the fascinating topics of AWS and cloud computing, the spatial web, and the Three.js/React Three Fiber ecosystem with dedicated and more in-depth lectures in 2024. It's especially interesting as the software industry could see a potential push towards the need for spatial interfaces and cloud-based pixel streaming in the coming years due to the release of the Apple Vision Pro - more on that later.
Academic Updates
This quarter, my academic journey led me to critically examine the Quality of Life (QoL) concept and its significant role in mental health research and practice while working on my master's study. I delved into this multidimensional construct in my essay titled "Evaluating the Quality of Life - Critical Examination of its Application and Value".

In this piece, I explored how QoL, with its inherent subjectivity, provides a comprehensive measure of an individual's mental state, going beyond traditional symptom-focused metrics. I elaborated on tools such as the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (Q-LES-Q), which offer nuanced insights into patients' subjective well-being. It was a pleasant and brief departure from the more conventional neuroscience topics I'm studying for my master's degree.
On top of that, to enhance my learning framework, I transitioned from Google Keep to using Obsidian for my personal knowledge management. I'm building a second brain and making the markdown backend of Obsidian publicly available on my GitHub.

Neural/Cloud Interfaces
This quarter, I published my bachelor thesis from last year on ResearchGate, a platform and community I am keen to become more involved with. This is a strategic investment, as I aim to establish the term "neural/cloud interface" and be one of its initial contributors.

This brief journey back into motion graphics was a delightful reminder of the power of visual storytelling. It presents a perfect opportunity to keep my design skills sharp and to push my personal brand on YouTube. I eagerly look forward to the community's reaction as soon as I publish the final video in Q3 2023.
Side projects
In my last newsletter, I mentioned a side project I'm involved with exploring bioinformatics. My sister and I are collaborating on her research, which involves quantifying fluorescent cells in microscopic images.

The project is still in its early stages, so I'm taking the time to learn about data science. In the coming quarter, I hope to dedicate more free time and energy to exploring data science more deeply. This will depend on my future professional commitments and changes. I'm excited about this challenge and the chance to contribute to meaningful scientific research.
Pushing the Boundaries of Spatial Computing
The release of the Apple Vision Pro headset has reinvigorated my passion for spatial computing. I completed the Three.js Journey certificate course from Bruno Simon and dove into advanced React Three Fiber (physics and shaders), expanding my 3D programming abilities. The announcement that WebXR will be supported on Apple's headset is tremendously exciting. This will be a game-changer for spatial computing and the spatial web.

I look forward to seeing how Apple's headset will shape the future of XR and the spatial web. My focus remains on expanding my abilities in these cutting-edge domains, all of which will hopefully help me to contribute to the development of emulating the human mind on the internet.
Tesla: Wizard at War
I started reading a remade version of the biography about the legendary inventor Nikola Tesla from the same esteemed author Marc J. Seifer: "Tesla: Wizard at War".
Book cover of the Tesla: Wizard at War book I'm currently reading.I had previously read the original book back in the summer of 2021, and it remains one of the most transformative books I have ever read. I am eagerly looking forward to reading the new version. The insights into the eccentric life of Nikola Tesla are fascinating and inspiring. He devoted his life to advancing humanity, something I also strive to do.

Conclusion
In the approaching quarter, I plan to amplify my personal brand by sharing some of the captivating projects that consume a significant portion of my waking hours. My focus is particularly drawn towards spatial and cognitive computing, specifically emphasising the spatial web and machine learning.
With anticipated changes on the horizon regarding my profession, I am excited to fuse these disciplines with an additional deepened focus on neuroscience. This fusion will create an exhilarating journey filled with fresh insights and opportunities, always pushing my long-term goal of working on whole-brain emulation and uploading consciousness to the internet. Until our paths cross again, I bid you farewell!
