Q1 2023: My Mind's Odyssey: Neuroscience and Reflections
Photograph of me wearing the new IDUN Guardian Earbuds (IDUN Technologies, 2023).As I recently celebrated my 25th birthday, I found myself contemplating the nature of time and its impact on my life. In the midst of this introspection, I was struck by the idea of starting a personal newsletter, a departure from my usual scientific and technical writings.
The purpose of this newsletter, which I have fittingly named "Quarterly Updates" or simply "News", is to provide a platform for me to share my thoughts, ideas, and life updates with family, friends, coworkers, and random people on the internet. This outlet offers me the freedom to write without the constraints of adhering to a rigid structure or providing extensive citations, allowing me to indulge in the ebb and flow of my thoughts.

To me, this period represents a threshold beyond which the recent past begins to fade into the realm of nostalgia. This phenomenon manifests itself in various forms, from listening to a long-forgotten song to catching a whiff of a familiar scent or savouring a long-missed flavour.
It is in these quarterly intervals that I will share my musings, discoveries, and experiences, all the while embracing the unbridled freedom of expression that this format allows.
Pioneering the Future
As time marches forward, milestones come and go. Recently, I celebrated my 1.5-year workiversary with IDUN Technologies, a company at the forefront of cutting-edge brain-computer interfaces. Over the past year, we have diligently worked on our latest release: the IDUN Guardian platform.
The IDUN Guardian platform represents the culmination of tireless efforts to refine and advance our brain-sensing earbuds and accompanying software platform. Our new hardware version incorporates a host of improvements and an entirely new form factor, paving the way for groundbreaking applications in neuroscience, consumer health, and wellness. Meanwhile, our software platform has been meticulously crafted to enable bidirectional streaming, storage, and processing of neuronal data through the cloud.

As with any great endeavour, the journey has been riddled with obstacles and opportunities for learning. Through overcoming these challenges, I have expanded my knowledge and honed my skills in full-stack software engineering, all while being part of a team striving to make a lasting impact on the world.
We officially announced the release of the IDUN Guardian on April 1st. The potential of this technology is immense, and only time will reveal the full extent of its impact. It is with great pride and gratitude that I find myself in the unique position of helping to shape the future with this pioneering technology.
Embracing Education
The year commenced with a significant change in my life: the decision to return to the world of academia after a six-month hiatus. Although my break from formal education was filled with immersive bootcamps in machine learning, I yearned for a deeper understanding of the intricate workings of the human mind. Thus, I embarked on an exciting new journey - pursuing a part-time online Master's in Applied Neuroscience at the prestigious King's College London.

It may seem like an ambitious pursuit for someone unfamiliar with my aspirations. However, I firmly believe that acquiring a deep understanding of neuroscience, biology, psychology, and even philosophy is paramount to achieving these goals. The past three months have been nothing short of extraordinary as I have delved into two scientific essays covering various topics, from human brain organoids and animal models to attention and consciousness.
My current position at IDUN Technologies has provided invaluable experience, but it is the combination of this practical exposure and a strong foundation in neuroscience principles that will propel me forward in my quest to unravel the mysteries of human consciousness.
The Joy of Mentorship
As my personal and professional journeys unfold, I have been granted yet another rewarding opportunity: the role of an industry expert at the SAE Institute. Here, I have had the distinct pleasure of supporting three Bachelor's students in their thesis and final project endeavours. This experience has not only allowed me to share my accumulated knowledge but also to cultivate my teaching abilities and further refine my understanding of complex topics.

In many ways, this mentorship role serves as a reminder of my own academic journey, providing me with a renewed sense of appreciation for the guidance and support I have received along the way.
Through the act of mentoring, I continue to learn, and it is with immense gratitude that I embrace this opportunity to give back to the next generation of aspiring scientists, engineers, and designers.
Personal Explorations
In addition to my professional, academic and mentorship pursuits, I have devoted much time to personal exploration, particularly delving into Oxford's "A Short Introduction" book series on mathematical neuroscience and consciousness. This intellectual journey has been captivating as I grapple with the profound questions surrounding the nature of consciousness and its implications for our understanding of reality.

Machine Learning Adventures
While my fascination with consciousness and neuroscience continues to shape my academic journey, my passion for machine learning remains vital to my personal and professional growth. As mentioned, I completed bootcamps at Constructor Learning and Udacity in Applied Machine Learning and MLOps Engineering.
Certificates of bootcamps I finished in the previous months.The intersection of machine learning and neuroscience is a fertile ground for innovation and discovery. Thankfully, my work at IDUN Technologies enables me to maintain a strong connection with these subjects, as I am constantly exposed to projects involving neuronal data and the intricacies of the human mind. This unique vantage point allows me to apply my machine learning skills meaningfully and transformatively.
To further explore this dynamic interplay, I have begun working on side projects in the field of neuroinformatics, where my newfound machine learning expertise is being put to the test. Eager to expand my knowledge and refine my skills, I am committed to diving headfirst into these projects, maintaining the same drive and determination that have characterised my pursuits thus far.
Building a Public Brand
In my ongoing pursuit of knowledge and growth, I recognise the importance of building a public brand and sharing my journey with those who share similar interests and aspirations. The creation of this newsletter is a testament to that commitment, providing a platform through which I can document my progress and engage with others passionate about whole brain emulation, mind uploading, and the broader field of neurotechnology.

Among these platforms, my account on HuggingFace stands out as a particularly notable addition. This online space is dedicated to showcasing my endeavours as a machine learning engineer, providing a transparent and accessible way for others to witness my growth and development within the field.
A Tapestry of Passions
In the twilight of this narrative, I find myself drawn to yet another realm of tiny exploration: the world of 3D programming and spatial computing. Despite the myriad pursuits that occupy my time, the allure of this fascinating domain has proven irresistible as I embark on a new side project with a dear friend. Together, we endeavour to create a small proof of concept for an augmented reality keyboard that adheres to the user's hand and boasts GPT-4 autocomplete functionality and an innovative design.

The rapid advancements in 3D technology, generative AI, and client-side machine learning (e.g., WebGPU) serve as powerful reminders of the ever-evolving landscape that lies before us.
As I immerse myself in the cutting-edge world of the WebBluetooth API for IDUN Technologies and eagerly anticipate the release of Apple's mixed reality headset and Meta's Quest 3, I cannot help but ponder the future of spatial computing and IoT/edge AI. A harmonious blend of intelligent client-side applications, low-latency edge cloud streaming, and potent cloud-based GPUs may herald a new era of spatial and cognitive computing innovation.
